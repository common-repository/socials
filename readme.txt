Share posts on your social media... It's easy!
Social Sharing is a simple plugin that will improve your blog workflow. With one button you can share the prepared post on your Facebook fanpage.

= Minimum Requirements =

* PHP version 5.4.0 or greater (PHP 7.2 or greater is recommended)

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Social Sharing, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type Social Sharing and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
